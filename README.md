# Daveloper's Nix Config

It's a nix config. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

* Plasma 6 with plasma-manager
* Basic KWin; no fancy tiling window manager (there are some old commits with Niri working, but I'm not into that).
* JetBrains stuff
* Warp Terminal (screw the telemetry, but I really like their text input)
* Ghostty, dunno why
* Firefox (tried Falkon, but it crashes)
